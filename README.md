## Live Url: https://gym-class-schedule.vercel.app

## Story

The Gym Class Scheduling and Membership Management System is designed to manage gym operations efficiently. The system defines three roles: Admin, Trainer, and Trainee, each with specific permissions. Admins are responsible for creating and managing trainers, scheduling classes, and assigning trainers to these schedules. Each day can have a maximum of five class schedules, with each class lasting two hours. Trainers conduct the classes and can view their assigned class schedules but cannot create new schedules or manage trainee profiles.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: User sign-up, login, and role-based access control (Admin/Trainer/Trainee).
- **Trainer Management**: Admins can add, update, delete trainer.
- **Class Management**: ADmin can create, update, delete class schedule.
- **Booking System**: trainee can book their class.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ORM
- **Validation**: Zod for input validation
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication
- **Error Handling**: Global error handling middleware
